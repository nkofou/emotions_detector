You can build the project with gradle according to the following instructions:
https://developer.android.com/studio/build/building-cmdline
or you can open it from android studio. 
From the Build tab, you'll select "Build Bundle(s)/APK(S)" > "Build APK"
and then choose the "Locate" option in the window that will pop up.
Then you have to transfer the APK file to your device in some way (e.g. e-mail).
